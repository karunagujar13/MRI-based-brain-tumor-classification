# MRI-based-brain-tumor-classification

This project detects and classifies brain tumor MRI images into three classes: Glioma tumor, Meningioma tumor, Pituitary and No tumor. 
The dataset is available on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri. Processed images are used to train convolutional neural networks to classify the images into four classes.
